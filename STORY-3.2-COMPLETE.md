**Completion Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Story Type:** Verification Story (No Implementation Required)  
**Time Spent:** ~1 hour  
**Code Changes:** 0 lines  
**All Tasks:** 11/11 Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

Story 3.2 successfully verified that task energy level functionality was fully implemented during Epic 1 (Stories 1.2/1.3). All three acceptance criteria were validated through code verification, automated testing, and manual end-to-end testing.

## Acceptance Criteria Results

### ‚úÖ AC1: Energy Level Picker on Create/Edit Task
**Status:** VERIFIED & TESTED
- UI component exists in `TaskFormView.swift`
- Three options: "‚ö°Ô∏è High", "üåô Low", "‚≠êÔ∏è Any"
- Segmented picker style
- Works on both create and edit flows
- **Manual Test:** PASSED - Picker displays correctly and allows selection

### ‚úÖ AC2: Default is "Any"
**Status:** VERIFIED & TESTED
- Task model default: `energyLevel = "any"`
- ViewModel `resetForm()` sets default to "any"
- **Manual Test:** PASSED - New tasks default to "‚≠êÔ∏è Any" without user action

### ‚úÖ AC3: Energy Level Saved to Backend
**Status:** VERIFIED & TESTED
- DataRepository saves entire Task struct via Firestore Codable
- `createTask()` and `updateTask()` both persist energyLevel
- **Manual Test:** PASSED - Firestore Console confirmed energyLevel field persists
- **Manual Test:** PASSED - Energy level persists across app restarts

---

## Test Results

### Automated Testing: ‚úÖ PASSED

**Unit Tests (TaskViewModelTests.swift):**
- 25 test assertions covering energyLevel functionality
- `testCreateTask_WithValidInput_Success()` - ‚úÖ PASSED
- `testCreateTask_ResetsFormOnSuccess()` - ‚úÖ PASSED
- `testUpdateTask_WithValidInput_Success()` - ‚úÖ PASSED
- `testLoadEditingTask_PopulatesForm()` - ‚úÖ PASSED
- Part of 170+ comprehensive test suite

**Integration Tests (DataRepositoryTests.swift):**
- 12 test assertions covering energyLevel persistence
- Firestore Codable encoding verified
- Create/Update/Retrieve operations all include energyLevel
- All tests passing

### Manual Testing: ‚úÖ PASSED

**Test 5: Create Task with Energy Level**
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Created task with "High" energy level
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Energy Level picker displays 3 options
- ‚úÖ PASSED - "Any" is default selection
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Task saved successfully
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Firestore Console shows `energyLevel: "high"`

**Test 6: Edit Task Energy Level**
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Tapped existing task to edit
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Current energy level displays in picker
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Changed energy level to "Low"
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Task updated successfully
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Firestore Console shows `energyLevel: "low"`

**Test 7: Default Energy Level**
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Created task without changing picker
- ‚úÖ PASSED - "‚≠êÔ∏è Any" selected by default
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Task saved successfully
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Firestore Console shows `energyLevel: "any"`

**Test 8: Energy Level Persistence**
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Created 3 tasks with different energy levels:
  - "Write technical documentation" ‚Üí ‚ö°Ô∏è High
  - "Check emails" ‚Üí üåô Low
  - "Review meeting notes" ‚Üí ‚≠êÔ∏è Any
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Closed and reopened app
- ‚úÖ PASSED - All tasks retained correct energy levels
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Edit flow shows correct saved values
- ‚úÖ PASSED - Firestore Console confirms all 3 energyLevel values persist

| **Task Form UI** | `TaskFormView.swift` | ‚úÖ Verified | Energy Level picker with 3 options, segmented style |
| **Task ViewModel** | `TaskViewModel.swift` | ‚úÖ Verified | Handles energyLevel in create/update/reset operations |
| **Data Repository** | `DataRepository.swift` | ‚úÖ Verified | Persists energyLevel via Firestore Codable |
| **Unit Tests** | `TaskViewModelTests.swift` | ‚úÖ Verified | 25 assertions covering energyLevel |
| **Integration Tests** | `DataRepositoryTests.swift` | ‚úÖ Verified | 12 assertions covering persistence |

## Energy Level Design

### Task Energy Levels
- **"high"** - For focused, demanding tasks requiring concentration
- **"low"** - For light, easy tasks suitable when tired  
- **"any"** - Default - task can be done at any energy level

### Integration with Story 3.1 (Mood & Energy Check-in)
- User mood states: "high", "medium", "low"
- Task energy levels: "high", "low", "any"
- **Story 3.3** will implement matching logic:
  - User mood "high" ‚Üí Suggest tasks with energyLevel "high" or "any"
  - User mood "medium" ‚Üí Suggest tasks with energyLevel "any"
  - User mood "low" ‚Üí Suggest tasks with energyLevel "low" or "any"

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Story 3.2** - Complete (this story)
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è **QA Review** - Submit to QA team for final validation
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Story 3.3** - Begin "Suggest Tasks Based on Mood & Energy"
   - Will use task energyLevel data verified in this story
   - Will integrate with MoodEnergyState from Story 3.1
   - Depends on both Story 3.1 and 3.2 being complete

## Key Learnings

**Verification Story Pattern:**
- This story demonstrates the value of verification stories in agile workflows
- Confirms existing functionality meets new epic requirements
- Provides formal testing and documentation checkpoint
- Ensures data quality before dependent features (Story 3.3)

**Energy Level Architecture:**
- Task energy levels intentionally kept simple: "high", "low", "any"
- Mood energy levels more granular: "high", "medium", "low"
- Separation of concerns allows flexible matching logic in suggestion engine

**Test Coverage:**
- Comprehensive automated testing (37 assertions) gave confidence in verification
- Manual testing essential for validating end-to-end user experience
- Firestore Console verification confirmed data layer integrity

## Conclusion

Story 3.2 successfully validated that the energy level categorization feature for tasks is production-ready. The feature was implemented correctly during Epic 1 and requires no modifications. All acceptance criteria are met, all tests pass, and the foundation is set for Story 3.3 (mood-based task suggestions).

**Status:** ‚úÖ DONE - Ready for QA Review  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH  
**Ready for:** Story 3.3 Implementation
