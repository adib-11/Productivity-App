# Story 2.2: Visual Display Fixes

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** Visual overlap and z-index problems with small "Available" blocks

---

## 🐛 Issues Found During Manual Testing

### Issue 1: Border Overlap
**Problem:** Small "Available" blocks (15-30 min) had their dashed borders hidden behind commitment blocks above them, making them hard to distinguish.

**Root Cause:** All blocks had the same z-index, so rendering order was unpredictable. The `offset()` modifier doesn't affect layout, allowing visual overlap.

**Solution Applied:**
```swift
.zIndex(block.type == .commitment ? 1 : 0) // Commitments on top
```

**Result:** Commitment blocks now render on top (z-index 1), while "Available" blocks render below (z-index 0), ensuring proper visual layering.

---

### Issue 2: Tight Spacing
**Problem:** Blocks were too close together vertically, causing borders to touch and appear merged.

**Root Cause:** Vertical offset was only `+8` pixels from the calculated position.

**Solution Applied:**
```swift
y: calculateVerticalPosition(for: block.startTime) + 10 // Increased from 8 to 10
```

**Result:** Added 2px extra spacing between blocks for clearer visual separation.

## ✅ Gap Filtering Verification

### Confirming: Small Gaps Are Already Filtered

**Configuration:**
- `minimumTaskDuration = 15 * 60` seconds (15 minutes)
- `minimumGapBetweenEvents = 15 * 60` seconds (15 minutes)

**Algorithm Logic:**
```swift
let slotDuration = slotEnd.timeIntervalSince(slotStart)

if slotDuration >= configuration.minimumTaskDuration {
    freeSlots.append(FreeTimeSlot(startTime: slotStart, endTime: slotEnd))
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Gaps **exactly 15 minutes** → ✅ SHOWN (>= 15 min)
- Gaps **less than 15 minutes** → ❌ FILTERED OUT (< 15 min)

**This is correct!** The algorithm already filters out small gaps properly.

## 🎨 Visual Improvements Summary

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Small "Available" blocks hard to see (borders hidden)
- ❌ Blocks appearing merged/touching
- ❌ Inconsistent rendering order

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy (commitments on top)
- ✅ Proper spacing between all blocks
- ✅ Dashed borders always visible
- ✅ Small blocks readable with adaptive text sizing
- ✅ Gaps < 15 min correctly filtered (already working)

## 📊 Expected Visual Appearance

### Empty Block (Small - 15-30 min):
- Gray background (semantic color)
- **Dashed border VISIBLE** (not hidden behind commitments)
- Title only, no time range
- Smaller font (11pt)
- Compact padding (4px)

### Empty Block (Large - 30+ min):
- Gray background
- Dashed border
- Title + time range both visible
- Regular font (15pt)
- Normal padding (8px)

### Commitment Block:
- Blue background
- Solid border (via shadow)
- White text
- Always renders on top layer (z-index 1)

## 🧪 Manual Testing Verification

Please verify the following:

### Test A: Single Commitment with Small Gap
1. Add commitment: "Meeting" 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM
2. Next event at 11:00 AM (leaves 0 min gap after 15-min buffer)
3. **Expected:** NO "Available" block between (too small after buffer)

### Test B: Single Commitment with Exact 15-Min Gap
1. Add commitment: "Meeting" 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM  
2. Next available time: 10:45 AM (after 15-min buffer)
3. If next commitment at 11:00 AM: 15-minute gap exists
4. **Expected:** "Available" 10:45 AM - 11:00 AM shows (exactly 15 min)

### Test C: Visual Separation
1. Add multiple commitments with gaps
2. Observe borders of "Available" blocks
3. **Expected:** 
   - Dashed borders clearly visible
   - No overlap with commitment borders
   - Clear separation between all blocks

## 🔧 Files Modified

**TimelineView.swift:**
- Added `.zIndex()` modifier for proper layering
- Increased vertical offset from 8 to 10 pixels
- No changes to algorithm (already correct)

## ✨ Next Steps

1. Run app (Cmd+R)
2. Test scenarios A, B, C above
3. Verify visual improvements
4. Continue with remaining test scenarios
5. All functionality should work as designed!
