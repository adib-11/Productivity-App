# Goals and Background Context
### Goals
* Validate the core hypothesis that users will value automated scheduling combined with mood-based task suggestions.
* Achieve a Week 1 user retention rate of 20% to demonstrate early product-market fit.
* Empower users to feel more in control of their daily schedule and improve their task completion rate.

### Background Context
This document outlines the requirements for a new iOS productivity app designed for users with dynamic schedules, such as university students. Existing tools are often too rigid or too passive to meet their needs, leading to stress and lost productivity. This product aims to fill that gap by acting as an intelligent assistant that not only schedules a user's day but also considers their well-being and energy levels, a key differentiator in the crowded productivity market.
