# User Interface Design Goals
### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be simple, engaging, and encouraging. The app should feel less like a rigid planner and more like an empathetic assistant that helps users feel in control and productive without causing stress. The primary goal is to reduce the cognitive load of daily planning.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Visual Timeline:** The main view will be a clear, scrollable timeline of the user's day.
* **Drag-and-Drop:** Users will be able to manually adjust their schedule by dragging and dropping task blocks.
* **Simple Check-in:** A non-intrusive modal or prompt will ask for the user's mood/energy at key moments.
* **Quick-Add:** A persistent, easily accessible button (e.g., a floating action button) will allow for frictionless task entry.

### Core Screens and Views
* **Today View:** The main dashboard showing the generated schedule for the current day.
* **Task Inbox:** A separate screen to view, add, and manage the master list of all tasks.
* **Task Detail/Entry Screen:** A form for adding or editing a task's title and priority.
* **Mood Selector:** The simple interface for the user's daily energy check-in.
* **Settings:** For managing fixed commitments, account details, and preferences.

### Accessibility
* **Target:** WCAG AA compliance.

### Branding
* The UI should feel clean, simple, and engaging, taking inspiration from the simplicity and positive reinforcement loops seen in apps like **Duolingo**. The aesthetic should be encouraging and visually satisfying.

### Target Device and Platforms
* **iOS (Responsive):** The initial launch will be for iOS, with a design that works seamlessly across all modern iPhone screen sizes.
