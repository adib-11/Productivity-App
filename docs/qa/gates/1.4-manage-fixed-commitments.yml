# Implementation highlights
highlights:
  architecture:
    - "Excellent MVVM pattern with clean separation of concerns"
    - "Repository pattern properly abstracts Firebase from ViewModels"
    - "Proper dependency injection via @EnvironmentObject"
    - "Consistent async/await patterns throughout"
  
  testing:
    - "Comprehensive unit test coverage (31 tests, exceeds target of 20+)"
    - "Edit functionality fully tested after initial review feedback"
    - "Well-designed MockDataRepository for isolated testing"
    - "Both positive and negative test scenarios covered"
  
  code_quality:
    - "No compilation errors or warnings"
    - "Clean, self-documenting code"
    - "Proper error handling with user-friendly messages"
    - "Consistent naming conventions"

# Technical debt (minimal, documented)
technical_debt:
  deferred_items:
    - item: "Firebase Emulator integration tests incomplete (3 tests deferred)"
      risk_level: low
      mitigation: "All CRUD operations manually verified. Authentication checks tested. Can be completed in future story."
    - item: "Unused updateCommitment method in ViewModel"
      risk_level: low
      mitigation: "Edit flow uses saveEditedCommitment instead. Dead code doesn't affect functionality."

# Comparison to previous story (Story 1.3)
improvements_from_story_1_3:
  - "Added comprehensive edit flow implementation and testing"
  - "Repository pattern successfully implemented for data operations"
  - "Integration test framework established for future Firebase testing"
  - "Manual testing procedures documented and executed"
