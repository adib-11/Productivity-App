code_quality:
  implementation: "excellent"
  documentation: "comprehensive"
  architecture_alignment: "perfect"
  strengths:
    - "All acceptance criteria fully met"
    - "Firebase services verified with integration test"
    - "Proper SDK integration following best practices"
    - "Clear documentation for team onboarding"
    - "Correct project structure alignment"
  minor_notes:
    - "XCTest target recommended for future stories"
    - "Integration test in ContentView is temporary (expected)"

decision_rationale: |
  Gate set to PASS - all acceptance criteria fully satisfied:
  
  ✅ AC1: Firebase project created and configured
  ✅ AC2: iOS app connected to Firebase with proper SDK integration
  ✅ AC3: Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore Database services enabled and verified
  
  The implementation demonstrates excellent technical execution:
  - Firebase SDK 10.29.0+ properly integrated via SPM
  - FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore, and FirebaseFirestoreSwift packages added
  - Firebase.configure() correctly placed in App initializer
  - Integration test validates end-to-end connectivity (Auth + Firestore write operation)
  - Comprehensive documentation supports team collaboration
  - Project structure follows architecture specifications precisely
  
  Minor recommendation: Add XCTest target before Story 1.4 to support future testing requirements.
  This is not blocking for the current story as it's an infrastructure setup task with no 
  business logic requiring unit tests.
  
  Quality score: 95/100 (deducted 5 points for missing test infrastructure, which is 
  recommended but not critical for this infrastructure story).

next_steps: |
  Story 1.2 is COMPLETE and ready for Done status.
  
  Recommended actions for Story 1.3 (User Onboarding):
  1. Implement AuthManager service in Core/Services/
  2. Create authentication views in Features/Authentication/Views/
  3. Add XCTest target to project
  4. Remove temporary integration test from ContentView
  5. Build authentication ViewModels following MVVM pattern
