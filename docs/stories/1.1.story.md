## Dev Notes

### Project Configuration
**Platform & Framework:** 
- Native iOS app built with **SwiftUI 5.0+** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- Swift version: **5.9+** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- Minimum iOS deployment target: 16.0 (to support SwiftUI 5.0+)

**Architecture Pattern:**
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern is REQUIRED by PRD and must be strictly followed [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- Clear separation between UI (View), presentation logic (ViewModel), and data (Model)
- ViewModels interact with Repository layer, which handles Firebase SDK calls [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

**Repository Pattern:**
- A repository layer will abstract data operations [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#architectural-patterns]
- ViewModels → Repository → Firebase SDK
- This decouples application logic from backend provider

### Backend Configuration (For Context)
**Backend-as-a-Service:**
- Platform: **Firebase (Google Cloud)** [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]
- Key Services: Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database
- The app will use Firebase SDK for iOS for all backend communication
- Note: Firebase integration will be done in Story 1.2, but project should be structured to accommodate it

**Starter Template Recommendation:**
- Consider using Firebase or Supabase SwiftUI quickstart guide as reference [Source: architecture/introduction-starter-template.md]
- This provides pre-configured modules for authentication and database connectivity

### Unified Project Structure
The following structure MUST be created (this is the definitive project structure): [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

```
/iOS-Productivity-App/
├── App/
│   ├── App.swift               # Main app entry point
│   └── Assets.xcassets         # App icons, images, colors
│
├── Core/
│   ├── Models/                 # Data structures
│   ├── Services/               # Backend logic (Repository, Engine)
│   └── Utils/                  # Helper functions
│
├── Features/                   # Feature-specific UI and logic
│   ├── Authentication/
│   │   ├── Views/
│   │   └── ViewModels/
│   ├── Schedule/
│   │   ├── Views/
│   │   └── ViewModels/
│   └── TaskInbox/
│       ├── Views/
│       └── ViewModels/
```

### Data Models (For Reference)
The following data models will be implemented in future stories: [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#data-models]
- **User Model:** Managed by Firebase Authentication (no separate collection needed)
- **FixedCommitment:** Represents non-negotiable time blocks
- **Task:** Represents completable to-do items
- **ScheduledTask:** Represents Tasks placed in specific time slots

### Component Architecture (For Reference)
Key components that will be built in future stories: [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#components]
- **AuthManager (Service):** Manages authentication state and Firebase Auth SDK calls
- **DataRepository (Service):** Centralizes all Firestore CRUD operations
- **SchedulingEngine (Service):** Contains scheduling algorithm business logic
- **ScheduleViewModel (ViewModel):** Manages state for main "Today View"

### Repository Structure
- **Structure:** Single Repository [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#repository-structure]
- MVP consists of single iOS application with third-party managed backend

### Testing
**Testing Framework:**
- **XCTest** (Apple's native framework) for unit and integration testing [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- Tests will be added in subsequent stories
- Test files should follow standard Xcode test bundle structure

**Local Testing Tools:**
- Firebase Emulator (latest) for local testing of Firestore security rules [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#tech-stack]

### State Management
- Use native SwiftUI state management (@State, @ObservedObject, @StateObject) [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#tech-stack]
- This is the simplest approach for MVP

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT**

Story 1.1 successfully establishes a solid foundation for the iOS Productivity App. The implementation demonstrates careful attention to architectural requirements with a complete MVVM folder structure, proper Swift 5.9 and iOS 16.0 configuration, and comprehensive Git setup. All three acceptance criteria are fully met.

**Strengths:**
- Perfect alignment with `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` unified project structure
- Clean separation of concerns with Core/, Features/, and App/ organization
- Proper SwiftUI lifecycle implementation (@main)
- Comprehensive .gitignore for Swift/Xcode projects
- Well-documented README.md with clear project overview
- Forward-looking Firebase placeholder comment for Story 1.2

**Architecture Validation:**
- ✅ MVVM pattern correctly scaffolded
- ✅ Repository pattern structure prepared (Core/Services/)
- ✅ Feature-based organization implemented
- ✅ Clear separation between Views and ViewModels

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review. The code is clean boilerplate appropriate for project initialization.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✅ PASS - Standard Swift conventions followed (no project-specific standards document found)
- **Project Structure:** ✅ PASS - Exact match to `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` specifications
- **Testing Strategy:** ⚠️ N/A - Appropriate for initialization story (no testing document found)
- **All ACs Met:** ✅ PASS - 100% coverage (3/3 acceptance criteria fully implemented)

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1 - Xcode Project Created:**
- **Given** Xcode 15.0+ is installed
- **When** Developer creates new SwiftUI App project
- **Then** Project exists with Swift 5.9, iOS 16.0, proper bundle configuration
- **Coverage:** ✅ VERIFIED - project.pbxproj confirms SWIFT_VERSION=5.9, IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=16.0

**AC2 - Git Repository Initialized:**
- **Given** Project root directory exists
- **When** Git init is executed with .gitignore
- **Then** Repository has proper history and ignores build artifacts
- **Coverage:** ✅ VERIFIED - 3 commits exist, comprehensive .gitignore present

**AC3 - Basic Folder Structure Created:**
- **Given** MVVM architecture requirements
- **When** Folder structure is implemented
- **Then** All required directories exist and are Xcode-integrated
- **Coverage:** ✅ VERIFIED - All 16 required directories present and properly referenced in project.pbxproj

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Verified project configuration matches architectural requirements
- [x] Validated Git repository setup and commit history
- [x] Confirmed MVVM folder structure completeness
- [x] Checked Swift version and deployment target settings

**Recommendations for Future Stories:**
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Add XCTest target in Story 1.2 or 1.3 before implementing business logic (TEST-001)
- [ ] Move ContentView.swift to organized location when implementing first feature (STRUCT-001)
- [ ] Consider adding SwiftLint for automated code quality checks
- [ ] Add test folder structure: Tests/{Unit,Integration,UI}
- [ ] Create sample test files to establish testing patterns early

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

No security-sensitive code implemented yet. Project is properly configured for future security requirements:
- ✅ iOS Keychain will be available for secure token storage
- ✅ Firebase SDK integration prepared (Story 1.2)
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or credentials present

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

Minimal boilerplate code with no performance concerns. Project configured appropriately:
- ✅ iOS 16.0 minimum deployment target supports modern SwiftUI optimizations
- ✅ Swift 5.9 provides latest performance improvements
- ✅ Clean project structure enables efficient compilation

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security:** ✅ PASS - No security code yet; foundation ready for secure implementation  
**Performance:** ✅ PASS - Optimal configuration with minimal overhead  
**Reliability:** ✅ PASS - Standard Xcode initialization with version control  
**Maintainability:** ✅ PASS - Excellent folder organization and documentation

### Technical Debt Identified

**TEST-001: Missing Test Infrastructure** (Severity: Medium)
- **Debt:** No test target, no test files, no test folder structure
- **Impact:** Cannot validate business logic as it's implemented in future stories
- **Recommendation:** Add XCTest target and basic test structure in Story 1.2 or 1.3
- **Rationale:** For initialization story, this is acceptable. However, tests MUST be in place before ViewModels and Services are implemented.

**STRUCT-001: ContentView Location** (Severity: Low)
- **Debt:** ContentView.swift at project root instead of organized folder
- **Impact:** Minor inconsistency with feature-based organization
- **Recommendation:** Move to appropriate location when implementing first real feature view
- **Rationale:** This is standard Xcode boilerplate; can be addressed naturally when replaced/reorganized.

### Files Modified During Review

None. No code modifications were necessary.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** PASS → `docs/qa/gates/1.1-project-initialization.yml`

**Quality Score:** 80/100
- Base: 100
- Medium severity issue (-10): Missing test infrastructure
- Low severity issue (-10): ContentView location

**Decision Rationale:** All acceptance criteria are fully met with excellent architectural alignment. The identified issues are appropriate for a project initialization story and do not block progress. Test infrastructure is a priority for upcoming stories but not required for scaffolding.

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done**

Story 1.1 successfully delivers all required functionality. The project foundation is solid and ready for Story 1.2 (Firebase integration). Strongly recommend addressing test infrastructure in Story 1.2 or 1.3 before significant business logic implementation begins.
