# Introduction & Starter Template
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the iOS Productivity App, including the iOS frontend, the serverless backend, and their integration. It will serve as the single source of truth for the development team.


**Starter Template or Existing Project:**
Based on the PRD, this is a greenfield project. No specific starter template was mentioned. To accelerate development and ensure best practices, we recommend basing the project on a template or quickstart guide provided by our chosen Backend-as-a-Service provider (e.g., the official Firebase or Supabase SwiftUI quickstart guides). This will provide pre-configured modules for authentication and database connectivity, which aligns with our goal of a rapid MVP launch.
