# Bug Fixes for Story 3.3 & Task Inbox

## üêõ Bug #1: Task Suggestions Disappearing After 10-15 Seconds

**Reported By:** User  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Severity:** High (User Experience)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Problem Description

Task suggestion sheet was disappearing automatically after 10-15 seconds of being displayed, forcing users to reopen it.

### Root Cause

The issue was in `TimelineView.swift` where the task suggestion sheet used a conditional content block:

```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showTaskSuggestions) {
    if let energyLevel = selectedMoodEnergyLevel {  // ‚ùå PROBLEM
        TaskSuggestionView(...)
    }
}
```

**Why it disappeared:**
1. User selects mood (e.g., "High Energy")
2. `selectedMoodEnergyLevel` is set
3. Mood selector calls `await viewModel.loadCurrentMoodState()` to refresh mood
4. SwiftUI re-evaluates the sheet's content
5. If `selectedMoodEnergyLevel` becomes temporarily `nil` during state updates, the sheet content disappears
6. This caused the sheet to dismiss unexpectedly

### Solution Applied

**File:** `TimelineView.swift` (Line ~171)

**Before (Buggy):**
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showTaskSuggestions) {
    if let energyLevel = selectedMoodEnergyLevel {
        TaskSuggestionView(
            isPresented: $showTaskSuggestions,
            currentEnergyLevel: energyLevel,
            scheduledTaskIds: scheduledTaskIds,
            repository: viewModel.dataRepository
        )
    }
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showTaskSuggestions) {
    TaskSuggestionView(
        isPresented: $showTaskSuggestions,
        currentEnergyLevel: selectedMoodEnergyLevel ?? "medium", // Fallback to medium
        scheduledTaskIds: scheduledTaskIds,
        repository: viewModel.dataRepository
    )
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed conditional `if let` wrapper
- Added nil-coalescing fallback: `selectedMoodEnergyLevel ?? "medium"`
- Sheet content is now stable and won't disappear due to state changes

### Testing Instructions

1. Open app ‚Üí Go to Schedule tab
2. Tap mood selector FAB
3. Select "‚ö°Ô∏è High Energy"
4. Task suggestion sheet appears
5. **Verify:** Sheet stays open indefinitely (no auto-dismiss)
6. **Verify:** Can close only by tapping "Close" button
7. Repeat for all energy levels

### Expected Behavior After Fix

‚úÖ Task suggestions remain visible until user explicitly closes the sheet  
‚úÖ No automatic dismissal after time period  
‚úÖ Fallback to "medium" energy if state becomes nil (graceful degradation)

## üêõ Bug #2: Completed Tasks Appearing Above Uncompleted Tasks in Task Inbox

**Reported By:** User  
**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Severity:** Medium (User Convenience)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

### Problem Description

In the Task Inbox, tasks were sorted alphabetically by title, causing completed tasks to be intermixed with uncompleted tasks. This made it difficult for users to see which tasks still need attention.

### User Experience Issue

**Before Fix:**
```
‚òê A Task (incomplete)
‚òë B Task (completed)    ‚Üê Completed task in the middle
‚òê C Task (incomplete)
‚òê D Task (incomplete)
‚òë E Task (completed)    ‚Üê Completed task in the middle
```

**Desired (After Fix):**
```
‚òê A Task (incomplete)   ‚Üê All incomplete tasks first
‚òê C Task (incomplete)
‚òê D Task (incomplete)
‚òë B Task (completed)    ‚Üê All completed tasks below
‚òë E Task (completed)
```

### Root Cause

The `TaskViewModel.loadTasks()` method was fetching tasks from Firestore without any sorting logic. Tasks were displayed in whatever order Firestore returned them (likely alphabetical by title or by creation date).

### Solution Applied

**File:** `TaskViewModel.swift` (Lines 35-52)

**Before (No Sorting):**
```swift
func loadTasks() async {
    isLoading = true
    errorMessage = nil
    
    do {
        tasks = try await repository.fetchTasks()  // ‚ùå No sorting
    } catch {
        errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
    }
    
    isLoading = false
}
```

**After (Sorted):**
```swift
func loadTasks() async {
    isLoading = true
    errorMessage = nil
    
    do {
        let fetchedTasks = try await repository.fetchTasks()
        // Sort tasks: unchecked (incomplete) first, then checked (completed)
        // Within each group, sort alphabetically by title
        tasks = fetchedTasks.sorted { task1, task2 in
            if task1.isCompleted != task2.isCompleted {
                return !task1.isCompleted // False (uncompleted) comes before True (completed)
            }
            return task1.title.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare(task2.title) == .orderedAscending
        }
    } catch {
        errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
    }
    
    isLoading = false
}
```

**Sorting Logic:**
1. **Primary Sort:** Group by completion status (`isCompleted`)
   - `false` (uncompleted/unchecked) tasks appear **first**
   - `true` (completed/checked) tasks appear **last**
2. **Secondary Sort:** Within each group, sort alphabetically by title
   - Case-insensitive comparison using `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare`
   - Respects user's locale settings

### Testing Instructions

1. Open app ‚Üí Go to Tasks tab
2. **Setup Test Data:**
   - Create tasks: "Aardvark Task", "Zebra Task", "Middle Task"
   - Mark "Middle Task" as complete (check it off)
   - Mark "Aardvark Task" as complete
3. **Verify Sorting:**
   - Unchecked tasks appear at top:
     - "Zebra Task" ‚òê
   - Checked tasks appear at bottom (alphabetically):
     - "Aardvark Task" ‚òë
     - "Middle Task" ‚òë
4. **Test Dynamic Updates:**
   - Uncheck "Middle Task" ‚Üí Should move to top
   - Check "Zebra Task" ‚Üí Should move to bottom
5. **Test Multiple Unchecked:**
   - Create "Apple Task", "Banana Task", "Cherry Task"
   - Verify all appear at top in alphabetical order

### Expected Behavior After Fix

‚úÖ All uncompleted tasks appear at the top of the list  
‚úÖ All completed tasks appear at the bottom of the list  
‚úÖ Tasks within each group are sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)  
‚úÖ Sorting persists across app launches and data syncs  
‚úÖ Checking/unchecking a task immediately re-sorts the list

### Technical Details

**Why This Approach:**
- **Performance:** Sorting in-memory after fetch (no Firestore index needed)
- **Flexibility:** Easy to adjust sorting criteria in future
- **Reliability:** Works regardless of Firestore query order
- **User Experience:** Mimics standard to-do list conventions (Todoist, Things, etc.)

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
1. ‚ùå Firestore query with `.order(by: "isCompleted")` - Would require compound index
2. ‚ùå Computed property for sorted tasks - Would re-sort on every UI update
3. ‚úÖ Sort once after fetch - Best balance of performance and simplicity

## üß™ Regression Testing

Run these tests to ensure no side effects:

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run in Xcode
Cmd+U  # Run all tests
```

**Expected Results:**

- No new compilation errors

### Manual Tests

**Task Suggestions (Bug #1):**
- ‚úÖ Suggestions stay open until closed
- ‚úÖ Can switch between energy levels in selector
- ‚úÖ Sheet doesn't auto-dismiss after time period

**Task Inbox Sorting (Bug #2):**
- ‚úÖ Uncompleted tasks always at top
- ‚úÖ Completed tasks always at bottom
- ‚úÖ Alphabetical sorting within each group
- ‚úÖ Real-time re-sorting when toggling completion

**Edge Cases:**
- ‚úÖ Empty task list (no crash)
- ‚úÖ All tasks completed (sorted alphabetically)
- ‚úÖ All tasks incomplete (sorted alphabetically)
- ‚úÖ Single task (displays correctly)
- ‚úÖ Task with special characters in title (sorts correctly)
