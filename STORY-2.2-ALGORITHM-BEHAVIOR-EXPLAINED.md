# Story 2.2: Algorithm Behavior - Important Clarifications

## üéØ How the Free Time Algorithm Works

### Core Principle
The algorithm identifies **AVAILABLE time for scheduling tasks**, not a strict scheduling engine that moves commitments around.

---

## üìã Key Behaviors

### 1. Commitments Are Displayed at Their Actual Times
**Commitments are NOT shifted or moved.** They appear at the exact times they were scheduled.

Example:
- Meeting at 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM ‚Üí Shows at 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- Even if there's a 15-min gap requirement, the meeting stays at its original time

### 2. The 15-Minute Gap is Buffer Time AFTER Commitments
The `minimumGapBetweenEvents` creates buffer time **AFTER each commitment ends** before free time begins.

**Purpose:** Transition time, travel time, bio breaks, context switching

Example:
```
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Team Meeting (commitment)
11:00 AM - 11:15 AM: [BUFFER TIME - not shown]
11:15 AM - 12:00 PM: "Available" (free time slot)
```

### 3. Back-to-Back Commitments (Adjacent Times)
When commitments are scheduled back-to-back with **no gap between them**, they are displayed as-is.

**No free time block appears between them** because there's no room.

Example:
```
10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Workshop Part 1
11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Workshop Part 2
[No "Available" block between them]
12:15 PM - onwards: "Available" (buffer after Part 2)
```

**Timeline Display:**
- Workshop Part 1 at 10:00-11:00
- Workshop Part 2 at 11:00-12:00 (directly adjacent)
- Available 12:15-midnight (15-min buffer after Part 2)

### 4. Overlapping Commitments
If commitments overlap (e.g., 10-12 PM and 11-1 PM), they are **merged into one continuous block** before calculating free time.

**Merged Example:**
```
Before merge:
- Meeting A: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
- Meeting B: 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM

After merge:
- [Merged Block]: 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM

Free time:
- Available: 1:15 PM onwards (15-min buffer after merged end)
```

### 5. Minimum Slot Duration (15 minutes)
Free time slots **shorter than 15 minutes are filtered out** as they're too small for meaningful task scheduling.

Example:
```
Meeting A: 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM
Meeting B: 10:50 AM - 11:30 AM

Gap = 5 minutes (10:45-10:50)
After 15-min buffer = -10 minutes (not viable)

Result: NO "Available" block shown between them
```

## üé® Visual Display Improvements (Just Fixed!)

### Small Block Handling
For blocks **less than 40px height** (~15-20 minute duration):
- ‚úÖ Smaller font size (11pt instead of 15pt)
- ‚úÖ Shows ONLY title (no time range)
- ‚úÖ Reduced padding (4px instead of 8px)
- ‚úÖ Text scales down to 70% if needed (`.minimumScaleFactor(0.7)`)
- ‚úÖ Single line only (`.lineLimit(1)`)

This prevents text truncation and makes small blocks readable!

## üìä Test Scenario Corrections

### ‚ùå INCORRECT Expectation (Old Test):
"Back-to-back commitments should create a gap between them and shift the second one"

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Expectation (Updated Test):
"Back-to-back commitments are displayed at their original times with NO gap between them. The 15-minute buffer appears AFTER the last commitment."

---

## ü§î Why This Design?

### Use Case: Realistic Scheduling
Users schedule commitments at specific times (meetings, appointments, etc.). The app should:
1. **Display commitments at their actual times** (not move them)
2. **Show when you're FREE to schedule tasks** (between/after commitments)
3. **Account for buffer time** (15 min for transitions)

### Analogy: Calendar + Task Scheduler
- **Commitments** = Fixed appointments (like Google Calendar)
- **Free Time Slots** = When you can add tasks (like a to-do app)
- **Buffer Time** = Realistic transition period

## üß™ Testing Implications

When testing, verify:
1. ‚úÖ Commitments appear at their scheduled times
2. ‚úÖ Free time starts 15 minutes AFTER commitment ends
3. ‚úÖ Adjacent commitments don't have "Available" blocks between them
4. ‚úÖ Small blocks display cleanly without text truncation
5. ‚úÖ Overlapping commitments are merged
6. ‚úÖ Gaps < 15 minutes are filtered out

---

## üí° Future Enhancements (Not in Story 2.2)

Possible future features:
- Configurable gap duration per commitment type
- Smart scheduling that suggests optimal task placement
- Conflict detection for overlapping commitments
- Auto-adjustment when commitments change

**For now:** The algorithm provides a solid foundation for identifying available time windows! ‚ú®
