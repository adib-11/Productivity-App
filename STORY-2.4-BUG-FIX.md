# Story 2.4 Bug Fix - isTimeSlotAvailable() Logic Correction

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Fixed By:** Dev Agent (James)  
**Related Story:** 2.4 (Drag and Drop / Resize), discovered during Story 2.5 testing

## Problem Summary

Three Story 2.4 tests were failing:
- `testMoveScheduledTask_ValidFreeSlot` ❌
- `testResizeScheduledTask_ValidDuration` ❌
- `testIsTimeSlotAvailable_NoOverlap` ❌

All three tests failed with the same root cause: valid task movements were being rejected.

## Root Cause Analysis

The `isTimeSlotAvailable()` method in `ScheduleViewModel.swift` had flawed validation logic:

```swift
// OLD (INCORRECT) CODE:
private func isTimeSlotAvailable(startTime: Date, endTime: Date, excluding taskId: String?) -> Bool {
    // Check no overlap with commitments ✅
    for commitment in commitments { ... }
    
    // Check no overlap with other scheduled tasks ✅
    for scheduledTask in scheduledTasks { ... }
    
    // ❌ INCORRECT: Require new position to be within a freeTimeSlot
    let isWithinFreeSlot = freeTimeSlots.contains { slot in
        startTime >= slot.startTime && endTime <= slot.endTime
    }
    return isWithinFreeSlot  // ❌ This was too restrictive!
}
```

**The Problem:**
- `freeTimeSlots` are calculated by `calculateFreeTime()` which ONLY considers commitments, NOT scheduled tasks
- When you move a task, the `freeTimeSlots` array doesn't include the space currently occupied by scheduled tasks
- This meant you couldn't move a task to empty space between other scheduled tasks, even though there was no actual conflict

**Example Scenario:**
```
9:00 AM - Commitment (Meeting)
10:00 AM - [Empty space] ← Should be valid for task placement
11:00 AM - Scheduled Task A
12:00 PM - [Empty space] ← Should be valid for task placement
1:00 PM - Scheduled Task B
```

The old logic would reject moving a task to 10:00 AM or 12:00 PM because those times weren't in `freeTimeSlots` (which only tracked 10:00 AM-11:00 AM and 12:00 PM-1:00 PM as "free" before Task A and B were scheduled).

## Solution

**NEW (CORRECT) CODE:**
```swift
private func isTimeSlotAvailable(startTime: Date, endTime: Date, excluding taskId: String?) -> Bool {
    // Check no overlap with commitments ✅
    for commitment in commitments {
        if timeSlotsOverlap(...) { return false }
    }
    
    // Check no overlap with other scheduled tasks (excluding the one being moved/resized) ✅
    for scheduledTask in scheduledTasks {
        if scheduledTask.id != taskId {
            if timeSlotsOverlap(...) { return false }
        }
    }
    
    // Check if within day bounds ✅
    let calendar = Calendar.current
    let startOfDay = calendar.startOfDay(for: currentDate)
    guard let endOfDay = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: startOfDay) else {
        return false
    }
    guard startTime >= startOfDay && endTime <= endOfDay else {
        return false
    }
    
    // ✅ CORRECT: If no overlaps and within day bounds, the slot is available
    // Note: We don't check freeTimeSlots because they only account for commitments,
    // not scheduled tasks. Manual drag/drop allows placing tasks anywhere that doesn't
    // overlap with commitments or other scheduled tasks.
    return true
}
```

**What Changed:**
1. ❌ **Removed:** Free time slot requirement (was too restrictive)
2. ✅ **Added:** Day bounds check (prevent scheduling outside current day)
3. ✅ **Kept:** Commitment overlap check (immovable blocks)
4. ✅ **Kept:** Scheduled task overlap check (prevents task collisions)

## Validation Logic Summary

A time slot is now considered available if:
1. ✅ Does NOT overlap with any commitments
2. ✅ Does NOT overlap with other scheduled tasks (excluding the one being moved/resized)
3. ✅ Falls within the current day bounds (startOfDay to endOfDay)

This matches the expected UX behavior: users can manually place tasks anywhere that doesn't conflict with commitments or other tasks.

## Test Results (After Fix)

**Story 2.4 Tests:**
- ✅ `testMoveScheduledTask_ValidFreeSlot` - NOW PASSING
- ✅ `testResizeScheduledTask_ValidDuration` - NOW PASSING
- ✅ `testIsTimeSlotAvailable_NoOverlap` - NOW PASSING

**Overall Test Suite:**
- Before: 169/177 passing (8 failures)
- After Initial Fix: 176/177 passing (1 remaining failure in testMoveScheduledTask_InvalidOutOfBounds)
- After Final Fix: 177/177 passing ✅
- Story 2.4: All tests passing ✅
- Story 2.5: All 7 tests passing ✅

## Additional Fix: Workday Bounds Validation

After fixing the free time slot issue, one test remained failing: `testMoveScheduledTask_InvalidOutOfBounds`.

**Problem:** The bounds check was using calendar day bounds (midnight to midnight) instead of workday configuration bounds (e.g., 6 AM to midnight).

**Solution:** Updated `isTimeSlotAvailable()` to check against `schedulingEngine.configuration.workDayStart` and `workDayEnd` instead of calendar day boundaries.

```swift
// NEW: Check against workday configuration
let config = schedulingEngine.configuration
guard let workDayStartTime = calendar.date(
    bySettingHour: config.workDayStart, minute: 0, second: 0, of: startOfDay
) else { return false }

let workDayEndTime: Date
if config.workDayEnd == 24 {
    workDayEndTime = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: startOfDay)!
} else {
    workDayEndTime = calendar.date(
        bySettingHour: config.workDayEnd, minute: 0, second: 0, of: startOfDay
    )!
}

guard startTime >= workDayStartTime && endTime <= workDayEndTime else {
    return false // Outside workday bounds
}
```

This ensures tasks cannot be scheduled outside the configured work hours (e.g., no scheduling at 3 AM if workday starts at 6 AM).

## Impact Analysis

**Files Modified:**
- `ScheduleViewModel.swift` - Fixed `isTimeSlotAvailable()` method

**User-Facing Impact:**
- ✅ Users can now drag tasks to any valid empty space
- ✅ Users can resize tasks without artificial free time slot restrictions
- ✅ Task movements feel more natural and intuitive
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Technical Debt Addressed:**
- Fixed fundamental validation logic flaw
- Improved test reliability (3 flaky tests now stable)
- Better alignment between code behavior and UX expectations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Free time slots are for scheduling algorithms, not manual validation** - When users manually move tasks, they should only be constrained by actual conflicts (commitments/tasks), not by algorithmic free time calculations.

2. **Test failures reveal design flaws** - The failing tests weren't "bad tests" - they revealed that the validation logic was incorrectly implemented.

3. **Separation of concerns** - `freeTimeSlots` should only be used by the automatic scheduling engine (`scheduleAutomaticTasks()`), not for manual drag/drop validation.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and validated  
**Regression Risk:** Low (improved validation logic, all tests passing)  
**QA Notes:** Manual testing should verify drag/drop feels natural and unrestricted
