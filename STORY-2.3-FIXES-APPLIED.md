# Story 2.3 - Manual Testing Fixes Applied

## Date: October 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Now Indicator Z-Index Issue
**Problem:** Red "Now" line was appearing behind gray "Available" blocks but above blue commitment blocks.

**Root Cause:** Empty blocks had `zIndex(1)` while commitments had `zIndex(0)`, but the Now indicator had no explicit z-index, causing it to render in layer order.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `.zIndex(10)` to `currentTimeIndicatorView()` in `TimelineView.swift`
- Now indicator now appears above ALL blocks (commitments, tasks, and empty slots)

**File Changed:** `iOS-Productivity-App/Features/Schedule/Views/TimelineView.swift`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Previous Day Tasks Appearing Outside Timeline
**Problem:** Tasks scheduled for 3:18 AM (previous day) were showing at the top of the timeline, even though the app starts at 6 AM.

**Root Cause:** 
- `generateTimeBlocks()` was including all scheduled tasks without filtering by date
- Tasks from previous days were being rendered with negative vertical positions

**Fix Applied:**
- Added date filtering in `generateTimeBlocks()` to only include tasks within `startOfDay` to `endOfDay`
- Added position clamping in `calculateVerticalPosition()` to prevent negative offsets
- Filtered both commitments and scheduled tasks to current day only

**Files Changed:**
- `iOS-Productivity-App/Features/Schedule/ViewModels/ScheduleViewModel.swift`
- `iOS-Productivity-App/Features/Schedule/Views/TimelineView.swift`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Auto-Schedule Button Non-Functional
**Problem:** Top-right sparkles button wasn't triggering task scheduling.

**Root Cause:** 
- Button was defined and wired correctly
- Missing debug logging made it unclear if tasks were being scheduled
- Scheduled tasks weren't being reloaded after saving

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced `scheduleAutomaticTasks()` with comprehensive logging
- Added explicit reload of scheduled tasks after saving
- Added print statements to track:
  - Total tasks fetched
  - Must-do tasks found
  - Free slots available
  - Scheduled vs unscheduled counts
  - Success/failure messages

**File Changed:** `iOS-Productivity-App/Features/Schedule/ViewModels/ScheduleViewModel.swift`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Timeline Shows 6 AM - 12 AM Instead of Full 24 Hours
**Problem:** Timeline only displayed 6 AM to midnight, not matching Apple Calendar's full 24-hour view.

**Requirement:** Users should be able to schedule tasks at any time, including late night/early morning hours.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `startHour` from `6` to `0` (midnight)
- Changed `endHour` remains `24` (midnight next day)
- Updated `SchedulingConfiguration` defaults:
  - `workDayStart: 0` (was 6)
  - `workDayEnd: 24` (unchanged)
- Timeline now shows full 24-hour period: 12 AM ‚Üí 12 AM

**Files Changed:**
- `iOS-Productivity-App/Features/Schedule/Views/TimelineView.swift`
- `iOS-Productivity-App/Core/Models/SchedulingConfiguration.swift`

## Testing Instructions

### Build & Run
```bash
# Clean build to ensure all changes compile
cd /Users/adib/Desktop/Code/iOS-Productivity-App
xcodebuild clean build -project iOS-Productivity-App.xcodeproj -scheme iOS-Productivity-App
```

### Manual Test Scenarios

**Test 1: Now Indicator Layering**
1. Open app during work hours
2. Verify red "Now" line appears ABOVE all blocks (blue commitments, green tasks, gray empty slots)
3. Scroll timeline - Now indicator should always be visible on top

**Test 2: Date Filtering**
1. Check console logs for "filtered to today" messages
2. Verify no tasks/commitments from previous days appear
3. Scroll to top (12 AM) - should only see today's early morning items

**Test 3: Auto-Schedule Button**
1. Create 2-3 must-do tasks in Task Inbox
2. Ensure some free time exists (not fully booked day)
3. Tap sparkles button (top right)
4. Watch console for:
   ```
   üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Fetched X total tasks
   üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Found Y must-do tasks
   üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Found Z free slots
   üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Scheduled A, Unscheduled B
   ```
5. Green task blocks should appear in free time slots
6. If insufficient time ‚Üí alert should display

**Test 4: Full 24-Hour Timeline**
1. Scroll timeline all the way up - should start at 12 AM (midnight)
2. Scroll all the way down - should end at 12 AM (midnight next day)
3. Hour labels should show: 12 AM, 1 AM, 2 AM... 11 PM, 12 AM
4. Total visible hours: 24 (not 18)

## Known Issues / Future Work

1. **Firestore Index Still Required**
   - scheduledTasks query needs composite index on `date` + `startTime`
   - Create via Firebase Console or deploy `firestore.indexes.json`

2. **Timezone Handling**
   - Fixed in DataRepository to use `TimeZone.current`
   - Verify commitments/tasks stored with correct local timezone

3. **Manual Testing Tasks Still Pending**
   - Story 2.3 Tasks 14-17 (manual QA) need completion
   - Once verified, mark story as "Ready for Review"

## Debug Console Checklist

When running the app, you should see these log patterns:

```
üîµ ScheduleViewModel: loadCommitments() called
üü¢ DataRepository: Local timezone: America/Los_Angeles
üü¢ DataRepository: Fetched X commitment documents
üü° generateTimeBlocks: Created Y commitment blocks (filtered to today)
üü° generateTimeBlocks: Created Z task blocks (filtered to today)
```

When tapping Auto-Schedule button:
```
üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Starting...
üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Fetched X total tasks
üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Found Y must-do tasks
üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Found Z free slots
üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Scheduled A, Unscheduled B
üü£ scheduleAutomaticTasks: Completed successfully
```
